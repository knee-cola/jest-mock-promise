/**
 * Synchronous Promise, which gets settled (resolved or settled) in a synchronous manner.
 *
 * `JestMockPromise` was written to simplify unit testing mocking (i.e. in [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) )
 *
 * In order to simplify synchronious promise settling two additional methods
 * were added to the promise instance:
 *   - `resolve` = forces the given promise to be resolved right away
 *   - `reject` = forces the given promise to be rejected right away
 *
 * By using these methods, we can write something like (provided that the Promise is mocked):
 *
 *    let promise = ExternalComponent.doAyncWork();
 *    promise.resolve({ label: 'this is some mock data' });
